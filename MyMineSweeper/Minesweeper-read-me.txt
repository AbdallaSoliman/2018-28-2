*Minesweeper:
it is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field. The game originates from the 1960s, and has been written for many computing platforms in use today. It has many variations and offshoots.

The purpose of the game is to open all the cells of the board which do not contain a bomb. You lose if you set off a bomb cell.

Every non-bomb cell you open will tell you the total number of bombs in the eight neighboring cells. Once you are sure that a cell contains a bomb, you can right-click to put a flag it on it as a reminder. Once you have flagged all the bombs around an open cell, you can quickly open the remaining non-bomb cells by shift-clicking on the cell.

Happy mine hunting!
